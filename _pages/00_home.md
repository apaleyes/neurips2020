description: A venue for self-reflection in machine learning research
---


The [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) Retrospectives Workshop is about reflecting on machine learning research. This workshop builds upon the [NeurIPS 2019 Retrospectives Workshop](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2019/) and [ICML 2020 Retrospectives Workshop](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/icml2020/) and encourages the exploration of a new kind of scientific publication, called *retrospectives*.

In conjunction with [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), the workshop will be held virtually.  Please see our [schedule](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2020/schedule/) for details.
