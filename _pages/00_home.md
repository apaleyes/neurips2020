description: A venue for reflection in machine learning research
---


The ML-RSA @ [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) 2020 Workshop is about reflecting on machine learning research. 
This workshop is a new edition of [NeurIPS 2019 Retrospectives Workshop](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2019) and [ICML 2020 Retrospectives Workshop](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/icml2020/). While earlier the focus of the workshop was primarily on Retrospectives, this time the focus is on surveys & meta-analyses. The enormous scale of research in AI has led to a myriad of publications. Surveys & Meta-Analyses meet the need of taking a step back and looking at a sub-field as a whole to evaluate actual progress. However, we will also accept retrospectives.

In conjunction with [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), the workshop will be held virtually.  Please see our [schedule](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2020/schedule/) for details.
